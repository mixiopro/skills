# Project Surface Taxonomy

`project surface taxonomy` is the repository layer for designing how a long-running screenplay project should persist state, expose entrypoints, assemble packets, and separate editable truth from runtime artifacts.

It exists because a strong screenplay agent system is not only a routing problem. It is also a persistence and workflow-surface problem.

## Why This Layer Exists

Once a project runs beyond one reply, three questions become unavoidable:

- what files or artifacts are the editable source of truth;
- what files are only runtime state, caches, mirrors, or telemetry;
- how planning, drafting, review, compliance, and export surfaces hand off to each other.

If those layers are collapsed together, creative systems drift silently:
- people edit the wrong files;
- agents re-ingest stale mirrors as truth;
- handoffs become opaque;
- review outputs stop being traceable back to the packet that produced them.

## Core Terms

- `source_of_truth`: human-editable canonical artifacts that should be changed directly.
- `runtime_state`: derived artifacts, packet compilations, workflow state, caches, and telemetry.
- `canonical_packet`: the bounded assembled input for one concrete writing or review action.
- `entrypoint`: the named workflow surface that starts a phase, such as planning, drafting, reviewing, or exporting.
- `review_surface`: the checkpoint artifact where quality, compliance, continuity, or delivery concerns are evaluated.
- `export_surface`: the delivery artifact for downstream human teams, platforms, or tools.
- `sync_rule`: the rule that says how changes in canonical source must propagate to derived runtime state.

## Design Rules

1. Keep canonical truth editable and visible.
2. Keep runtime artifacts derived and disposable by default.
3. Make packet assembly inspectable.
4. Give each workflow phase a clear entrypoint and handoff.
5. Let review and export surfaces be explicit rather than hidden side effects.
6. Never let mirrors or caches quietly become the real source of truth.

## What This Layer Should Prevent

- editing derived files because they look easier to reach;
- turning long-horizon collaboration into a pile of unnamed state blobs;
- hiding what context actually went into a generation or review step;
- mixing planning artifacts with delivery artifacts until neither is trustworthy;
- forcing every screenplay medium to use the same artifact ladder without adaptation.

## Relation To Other Layers

- `team_workflow_blueprint` chooses the collaboration family.
- `expert_subagent_cast` chooses who participates.
- `subagent_dispatch_plan` chooses how they run.
- `project_surface_map` chooses where truth lives, what runtime produces, and how packets and exports are assembled.
