> Not a prompt dump. Not a single-method gospel. Not a UI-first product.
> Durable creative infrastructure for screenplay work: routable knowledge, clear workflow contracts, reusable review logic, and community-driven correction loops.

## Quick Example

**Request**

```text
Turn this idea into a feature-film beat sheet:
"A journalist who has spent years avoiding the truth behind her father's death
is forced back to her mining hometown to investigate an old case."
```

**Selected route** → [`skill.structure-beat`](./skills/structure-beat/SKILL.md) + [`wp.structure-beat-outline`](./knowledge/20-workflows/wp-structure-beat-outline.md)

**Artifact excerpt**

```text
## Beat List
- Opening imbalance: She avoids every mining story that crosses her desk.
- Lock-in: A fragment from her father's case file forces her back home.
- Midpoint turn: She learns her own silence helped protect the cover-up.
```

## What This Is

This repository isn't a prompt library or a single-method writing course. It's durable, composable screenwriting infrastructure built for both humans and LLM agents.

It classifies your request by **intent, medium, stage, and desired output**, then loads only the relevant knowledge — protocol, rubric, and reference atoms — to produce a structured artifact. It self-checks before handing you the result. When you push back, your feedback becomes better assets for the next run.

If you're a writer: it's a structured development and review toolkit. If you're building agent workflows: it's explicit routing logic with bounded loading and machine-readable contracts.

<details>
<summary>Codex</summary>

```toml

## Community & Status

This project grows through high-signal disagreement.

| Channel | Use for |
| --- | --- |
| [Discussions](https://github.com/XucroYuri/how-to-make-script/discussions) | Questions, rebuttals, field notes, rival paths |
| [Issues](./.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE) | Concrete route, rubric, or asset changes |
| [Security](./SECURITY.md) | Private vulnerability reporting |

**Current:** Usable research-first screenplay monorepo. Strong routing, loading, and quality-gating infrastructure. Broad narrative/commercial/interactive coverage.

**Open gaps:** Runtime execution not yet implemented. Bundle-planner enforcement incomplete. Edge-case fixture depth uneven. Some genre/stage-specific knowledge still thin. Discussion-to-asset conversion remains manual.

Good first contributions: challenge an overly broad claim, add a counterexample, improve a doc path, or turn a route mismatch into a fixture.
