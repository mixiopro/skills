# Mixio Screenwriting Bridge

This is the writer-development boundary between story work and Mixio production. Use the complete Mixio-owned `how-to-make-script` screenplay system for the eight requested routes, then hand off an approved screenplay package to `mixio-pipeline`.

## Companion requirement

The vendored repository is the source for the writing protocols, rubrics, knowledge atoms, schemas, examples, and router. The files under `skills/how-to-make-script/` are Mixio-owned and may be customized, but preserve the dependency graph and update [UPSTREAM.md](../how-to-make-script/UPSTREAM.md) when importing upstream changes. Do not copy only one route `SKILL.md`, paraphrase its dependencies, or silently replace a missing route with a generic screenplay answer.

The standard Mixio package installs the root skill recursively. For a local checkout, verify the owned package before using the bridge:

```bash
test -f skills/how-to-make-script/SKILL.md
test -f skills/how-to-make-script/UPSTREAM.md
test -f skills/how-to-make-script/skills/idea-discovery/SKILL.md
test -f skills/how-to-make-script/skills/quality-gating/SKILL.md
```

Load only the route that matches the current request:

- `idea-discovery` — vague idea, image, theme, or situation
- `logline-premise` — story engine needs compression and clarity
- `character-world` — character pressure, relationships, or world rules
- `structure-beat` — beat sheet, sequence, outline, or treatment
- `scene-writing` — scene card, scene draft, or screenplay draft
- `dialogue-subtext` — dialogue objectives, voice separation, and subtext
- `rewrite-doctor` — story-level diagnosis and rewrite prioritization
- `quality-gating` — screenplay contract, rubric, preflight, or recheck

## Ownership boundary

The screenplay system owns premise, character pressure, structure, scene/dialogue craft, story-level diagnosis, and screenplay quality. Mixio owns native screenplay persistence, exact Cast & World references, sheets, anchors, shot breakdown, visual continuity, generation, and rendered-media evaluation.

Do not confuse the layers:

- `rewrite-doctor` diagnoses story and text layers; `mixio-continuity` audits persisted shot logic.
- `quality-gating` checks screenplay contracts and craft lenses; `mixio-reference-audit` checks Cast & World readiness.
- Upstream-only writing work needs no Studio project/episode lookup and must not submit billable jobs.

## Handoff

Before entering Mixio Step 00/01, produce the handoff described in [screenplay-handoff.md](references/screenplay-handoff.md). The screenplay may be a draft, but its intent, constraints, and quality status must be explicit. Only `pass` or `pass_with_weaknesses` may cross into production; `needs_revision` stops at the upstream writing layer.

At the handoff boundary:

1. Resolve the Mixio project and episode according to `AGENTS.md`.
2. Read the native screenplay grammar and list existing references.
3. Normalize the screenplay into Mixio's native grammar and copy exact reference mentions; never invent Studio IDs or `#` tokens upstream.
4. Persist the screenplay as the Step 01 source of truth.
5. Continue through sheets, reference audit, breakdown, continuity, shot planning, and generation only through `mixio-pipeline`.

If story intent changes after Mixio Step 03, return to the upstream route and re-run the relevant quality gate before re-entering production. A screenplay edit after Step 03 invalidates downstream breakdown, continuity, shot planning, and generated media.

## Not this skill

Do not use this bridge for a request that is already a Studio production operation such as creating an episode, managing references, breaking a screenplay into shots, generating media, or evaluating renders. Use the corresponding Mixio skill or start at `mixio-pipeline` when the production step is unclear.
